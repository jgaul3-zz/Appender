# Appender
Small script to iterate through list of files and change the filetype. Made it when the .jpg for a lot of my phone's saved images got changed to .jp1, .jp2, etc. when trying to put them on my backup hard drive. Put the desired images in a "before" directory with the appender.py file, make an "after" directory, and you're golden.
